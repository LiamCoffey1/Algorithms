said david Gregory, University of Regina Interim Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and co-chair of the President&#8217;s Advisory Committee on Sustainability (PACS). &#8220;This theme really resonates with me as over the last five years the University of Regina has been engaged in a broad range of actions designed to reduce our environmental footprint and further our sustainability goals.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>In January 2016, PACS launched the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan for Sustainability targeting five areas to further our sustainability efforts: Leadership, Waste, Energy, Transportation and Community &amp; Engagement. Some notable achievements in each of these areas include:&#160;</p><table style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="04-221.jpg" class="" height="235" src="images/04-221.jpg" width="300" /></td></tr><tr><td><p>Multi-material recycling/waste stations<br /> installed in 2019. <em>Credit: John Papandreos,</em><br /><em> Facilities Management</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Leadership</strong></p><ul><li>Developed a Goods and Services purchasing policy which includes sustainability and ethics in the purchasing process principles;</li><li>Updated its Smoke-Free Campus Policy to become a smoke-free campus in 2018;

said Kathy McNutt, Vice-President (Research) and PACS co-chair. &#8220;It is also reassuring to me that the concern over our environment and the University&#8217;s need to take real action on issues such as climate change was consistently, and persistently, raised during the development of the University&#8217;s 2020-25 Strategic Plan &#8211; <em>All Our Relations: kahkiyaw kiw&#226;hk&#244;m&#226;kaninawak.</em>&#160;</p><p>&#8220;As a result of this input the 2020-25 Strategic Plan identifies Environment and Climate Action as one of five primary areas of focus with a goal of a 25 per cent reduction in our ecological footprint by 2025 compared to our current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, waste production and water consumption.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>PACS is currently developing the University&#8217;s 2021-26 Sustainability Action Plan and has identified nine areas of focus: Climate Action, Education, Energy, Engagement and Communication, Land Use, Leadership, Research, Transportation, and Waste which will form the foundation of the new plan.&#160;
