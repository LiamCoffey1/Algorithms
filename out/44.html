These are the ancestral lands of the Cree, Saulteaux, Dakota, Nakoda, and Lakota nations and the homeland of the M&#233;tis.</p><p>A comprehensive university, the U of R traces its roots back to the creation of Regina College, a small residential high school established by the Methodist church in 1911. The College grew in size and significance becoming a campus of the University of Saskatchewan and, ultimately, an independent degree granting university &#8211; the University of Regina &#8211; in 1974.</p>The U of R has:<br /><ul><li>10 faculties;</li><li>25 academic departments and schools;</li><li>18 research centres and institutes; and,</li><li>three federated colleges: Campion College, First Nations University of Canada, and Luther College.</li></ul><p>Some programs are also delivered with partners including Saskatchewan Polytechnic, regional colleges, Gabriel Dumont Institute, and Yukon University.</p><p>In 2020, the University of Regina recorded its 12<sup>th</sup> consecutive year of enrolment growth, growing by one per cent to 16,664 full-time and part-time students &#8211; a record number. Our tuition rates are on par with the national average and the University is second among comprehensive universities in the level of student financial support &#8211; scholarships, awards, and bursaries &#8211; available as a percentage of tuition.</p><p>In Regina, our main and historic College Avenue campuses are located on 239 acres in <u><a href="http://wascana.ca/">Wascana Centre</a></u>, one of the largest urban parks in North America, providing an attractive study and work environment for our students, faculty and staff.

Our history, our accomplishments, and our growth as a university stem from our commitment to working together for the good of our local and global communities.</p><h2>2020-2025 Strategic Plan: <em>All Our Relations, </em>kahkiyaw kiw&#226;hk&#244;m&#226;kaninawak</h2><p>The title of <u><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/strategic-plan/index.html">the University of Regina's 2020-2025 Strategic Plan, <em>All Our Relations</em></a></u>, is the English equivalent of a phrase familiar to most North American First Nations Peoples. It is often used to formally acknowledge the interconnectedness of family and all their relations including those that walk on two feet, those that walk on four feet, those that swim in the great waters, those that fly in the sky and those that crawl on their bellies.</p><p>Through the strategic plan, the University of Regina is committed to these <u><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/strategic-plan/area-focus/index.html">five areas of focus</a></u> and the specific goals related to each:</p><ul><li><span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/strategic-plan/area-focus/discovery/index.html">Discovery</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/strategic-plan/area-focus/truth-reconciliation/index.html">Truth and Reconciliation</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/strategic-plan/area-focus/well-being-belonging/index.html">Well-being and Belonging</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/strategic-plan/area-focus/environment-climate-action/index.html">Environment and Climate Action</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/strategic-plan/area-focus/impact-identity/index.html">Impact and Identity</a></span></li></ul><h2>Discovery</h2><p><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/strategic-plan/area-focus/discovery/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discovery</a> lays out the key aspects needed to bolster and strengthen the academic successes and careers of U of R students, faculty, and staff, as well as create impact within communities in Saskatchewan, Canada, and worldwide. It has three overarching objectives &#8211; Excellence in Teaching and Research, Student Success, and Internationalization.</p><h3>Excellence in Teaching and Research</h3><p>We teach and support students to think critically, to engage in ethical reasoning, to understand their worlds and the worlds of others, and to actively contribute to the betterment of society.</p><p>A diverse and inclusive environment assists in attracting and retaining teachers and researchers to the University&#8217;s faculties and units. It builds on the U of R&#8217;s existing areas of national expertise, such as the <span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/ctrc/">Child Trauma Research Centre (CTRC)</a></span>, the <span><a href="https://www.cipsrt-icrtsp.ca/">Canadian Institute for Public Safety and Research Treatment (CIPSRT)</a></span>, the <span><a href="https://co2-research.net/">Clean Energy Technology Research Institute (CETRI)</a></span>, and the <span><a href="http://www.ieesc.org/">Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainable Communities (IEESC)</a></span>, while seeking opportunities for new collaboration with other academics and institutions globally.</p><p>Beyond the classroom &#8211; in fieldwork, internships, performances, and academic exchanges &#8211; experiential learning takes place and creates new opportunities for discovery infused with the lived experiences of both teacher and student. As a result, the University&#8217;s focus on experiential learning better prepares students for life and work &#8211; adding to Saskatchewan&#8217;s economy and contributing to building a better quality of life for people and communities.</p><p>The University of Regina is home to more than 400 active researchers, including faculty members, graduate and undergraduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and nine Canada Research Chairs. Ten institutional-level research centres and institutes and numerous faculty-operated centres support research collaboration and partnerships focused on our research strengths.</p><p>Indigenous research is a growing focus as we encourage and support Indigenous ways of knowing. Several centres and institutes reflect this in their projects and partnerships.</p><p>With $25.7 million in research revenue in 2018-19, the University of Regina has emerged as a centre of excellence on a number of research fronts. Our&#160;<u><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/research/research-expertise/research-strengths/index.html">six thematic areas of research priority</a>,</u> which represent clusters of researchers, are based upon research impact, critical mass of highly qualified personnel, distinctiveness, and commitment to partners in the community and the Province of Saskatchewan.</p><p>Our commitment to discovery and opportunity extends beyond our campus and finds its meaning in research undertaken through community and international partnerships:</p><ul><li>The University of Regina was named the <span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/external/communications/feature-stories/current/2020/12-08.html">2020 Research University of the Year in the undergraduate university category</a></span> by Research Infosource, a leading source of ranking information on research and development in Canada. Based on six different categories, the designation is awarded to the university that demonstrates superior performance on key measures of research success.</li><li>The University received the highest research impact ranking among medium-sized comprehensive universities in Canada by size and number of disciplines in Innovating Life, (Sept. 2014).</li><li>The University achieved top ranking among comprehensive universities in international research collaboration by Research InfoSource. The rankings are based on the proportion of publications at each institution co-authored with researchers outside of Canada. For the period 2008-2012, over 51 percent of all publications by University of Regina researchers were co-authored with researchers abroad.</li></ul><h3>Student Success</h3><p>University of Regina graduates experience the best employment outcomes of all post-secondary graduates in Saskatchewan. We are leaders in the critical area of experiential learning, and our graduates leave our campus prepared to succeed in the world. In 1969 we were the first university in Western Canada to offer co-operative placements, and we now offer the <u><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/careercentre/coop/index.html">Co-operative Education &amp; Internships Program</a></u> in more than 50 programs in the Faculties of Arts, Business Administration, Engineering and Applied Science, and Science.</p><p>Experiential learning components in our degree programs result in our co-operative education students earning approximately $10 million in wages per year. Over the last decade, co-op job placements and internships have grown by 60 per cent, as we continue to develop career-ready graduates and connect students with potential employers.</p><p>We were the first in Canada to guarantee career-related employment for those registered in our <u><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/urguarantee/">UR Guarantee Program</a></u>. Established in 2009, the UR Guarantee Program provides students with access to critical academic, leadership and service opportunities throughout their undergraduate study. Students successfully completing the program should possess the skills and knowledge necessary to start their careers within six months of graduation. If a student is not successful, the University will pay for one year's worth (30 credits) of additional undergraduate tuition and course fees.</p><h3>Internationalization</h3><p>One of the key strengths of the University of Regina is the outstanding growth in enrolment of international students in recent years. In 2020, international students comprised 17.7 per cent of total students.</p><p>These students bring diversity and different worldviews and perspectives that add to the strength of our University and community. In many cases, international students end up moving to Saskatchewan permanently, supporting the growth of our province and economy.</p><p>In addition to bringing the world to our campus, we work with community stakeholders, government organizations and funding agencies at home and abroad and partner with academic institutions globally to collaborate on teaching, research, and community-development.</p><p>In 2020, the University had 309 international institutional agreements with 44 countries facilitating opportunities for student mobility, research, and faculty mobility. Our international reach continues to extend outwards with positive results.</p><h2>Truth and Reconciliation</h2><p>The University of Regina&#8217;s commitment to <span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/strategic-plan/area-focus/truth-reconciliation/index.html">Truth and Reconciliation</a></span> is the second of five interconnected areas of focus in our 2020-2025 Strategic Plan.</p><p>The Plan envisions a future where people put aside their differences to focus on their similarities &#8211; a key concept in working towards Reconciliation.</p><p>Over the past decade, the University of Regina has witnessed the steady growth of students self-declaring as Indigenous &#8211; now making up 14.7 per cent of the U of R&#8217;s student population.</p><p>Institutional changes at the University&#8212;while still ongoing&#8212;have made the campus more attractive to Indigenous students. This includes initiatives such as the <span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/student/asc/">ta-taw&#226;w Student Centre</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/student/asc/programs-services/OMA/index.html">nit&#244;ncip&#226;min om&#226; Student Success Program</a></span> (The OMA Program), Indigenous Social Work and Education programs, the Indigenous Advisory Circle and its Indigenization Fund, and the search for an Associate Vice-President (Indigenous Engagement), among others.</p><h2>Well-being and Belonging</h2><p><span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/strategic-plan/area-focus/well-being-belonging/index.html">Well-being and Belonging </a></span>relates to three interconnected objectives:</p><ul><li>Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)</li><li>Healthy Living</li><li>Mental Health Literacy and Research</li></ul><p>By taking this holistic approach, the Strategic Plan highlights the importance of belonging and the many facets of well-being to the success of students, staff, and faculty.</p><p>Current and planned initiatives supporting well-being and belonging include:</p><ul><li>Creation of an EDI Action Plan to promote and help build an inclusive organizational culture that integrates EDI considerations into teaching, research, and learning.</li><li>Venues such as the <span> Paul Schwann Applied Health and Research Centre</span>, which extends the our impact beyond the University and into communities throughout Saskatchewan.</li><li>A new Student Wellness Centre offering inclusive primary health-care services to U of R students by establishing regular clinics and walk-in schedules.</li><li>A <span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/mental-wellness/">Mental Wellness Hub </a></span>launched in September 2020, which plays a pivotal role in achieving our objectives of providing internal and external resources for the education, training, and mental health literacy for our students, faculty, and staff. The Hub is one part of the University&#8217;s overarching Mental Health Strategy and is designed to educate, inform, and foster collaboration of mental well-being initiatives, services, and resources.</li><li>A commitment to prioritizing and supporting mental health research to improve the lives of people in Saskatchewan and throughout the country.This work includes the <span><a href="https://www.onlinetherapyuser.ca/">Online Therapy Unit</a></span> and institutes such as the <span><a href="https://www.cipsrt-icrtsp.ca/">Canadian Institute for Public Safety Research and Treatment</a></span> and the <span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/ctrc/">Child Trauma Research Centre</a></span>, making the University a national leader in mental health literacy and innovation, and creating a strong healthy workforce and communities.</li></ul><h2>Environment and Climate Action</h2><p><span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/strategic-plan/area-focus/environment-climate-action/index.html">Environment and Climate Action</a></span> &#8211; the fourth area of focus in our 2020-25 Strategic Plan &#8211; provides a framework for how the University will strengthen its connection with, and protection of, the environment and our climate through three major objectives:</p><ul><li>reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions</li><li>develop the University of Regina as a Living Lab</li><li>decrease the production of waste and consumption of water</li></ul><p>Each objectives is framed by the overarching goal to reduce the University&#8217;s ecological footprint by 25 per cent.</p><p>To help guide this cultural shift, the President&#8217;s Advisory Committee on Sustainability (PACS) will launch a new Action Sustainability Plan in January 2021.</p><p>To date, half of the University&#8217;s eight Canada Research Chairs focus on various aspects of clean energy development, water security, the environment, and climate change.</p><p>This area of focus also supports and builds on <span>the University&#8217;s </span>success at progressive energy management, including reducing electrical consumption by 20 per cent over the last decade.</p><h2>Impact and Identity</h2><p><span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/strategic-plan/area-focus/impact-identity/index.html">Impact and Identity</a></span> - the fifth area of focus &#8211; recognizes that the connections of our students, faculty, and staff with all of our stakeholders are key components of our ability to positively influence and impact society. We are committed to forging reciprocal relationships that generate interest in, and increase the societal relevance of our academic efforts.</p><p>We seek to enhance our institutional identity by valuing our alumni and their accomplishments; supporting and developing our research strengths and reputation; and celebrating our impacts and unique characteristics.</p><h2>Programs</h2><p>We offer more than <u><a href="https://urconnected.uregina.ca/program.do">120 undergraduate programs</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/gradstudies/future-students/programs/detailed-program-list.html">78 graduate programs</a></u>, including many specialized programs such as police studies and public policy.</p><ul><li>Our <u><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/engineering/">Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science</a></u> offers five interdisciplinary, systems-based undergraduate programs, all fully accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board.</li><li>Our <span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/arts/">Faculty of Arts</a></span>, with 13 departments, 20 undergraduate programs, a range of graduate programs, and 14 research centres, institutes, and labs, is one of the University of Regina's largest faculties in terms of student enrolment, the largest in terms of credit hours and number of tenure-stream faculty, and is the most disciplinarily diverse.</li><li>In September 1968, Regina&#8217;s first bilingual studies centre opened in the heart of the university campus. More than 50 years later,<u> <a href="https://lacite.uregina.ca/en">La Cit&#233; universitaire francophone</a></u> and the <span><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/education/Programs1/Undergraduate_Programs/lebac.html">Bac en &#233;ducation fran&#231;aise</a></span> program are the Francophonie&#8217;s proud representatives at the University of Regina. The two entities continue to work for the advancement of French-language university education on campus. La Cit&#233; offers a complete range of programming in French as a second language that meets the needs of learners from beginners to advanced levels.</li><li>We value inclusive education and provide programs and initiatives that support this goal such as the <u><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/cce/career-development/education-health/inclusive-education.html">Certificate in Extended Studies in Inclusive Education</a></u>, which enhances knowledge and expertise in fostering an inclusive classroom, and <u><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/student/accessibility/campus-for-all/">Campus for All</a></u>, an inclusive post-secondary education (IPSE) initiative for adults experiencing intellectual disability.</li><li>The University of Regina supports inclusion and diversity through programs such as the <u><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/housing/diversity-and-inclusion.html">Colourful Campus House</a></u>, a housing option specifically for 2SLGBTQIAP+ students in the College West residence. Also in College West, the multipurpose lounge on the fourth floor features special ventilation so the space can be used for smudging, ensuring Indigenous students can practice their culture freely and build a sense of belonging.</li><li>The <u><a href="https://www.uregina.ca/nursing/">Saskatchewan Collaborative Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program</a> (SCBScN)</u>, offered jointly with Saskatchewan Polytechnic, first accepted students in fall 2011. The four-year nursing degree program responds to the needs of the province, and is offered in Regina and Saskatoon with local cohort intakes in Swift Current and North Battleford.
